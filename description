#Working with Missing Data in Pandas DataSet to be used for AI/ML Projects
#------------------------------------------------------------------------

#In Pandas missing data is represented by two value:

#1) None: None is a Python singleton object that is often used for missing data in Python code.
#2) NaN : NaN (an acronym for Not a Number), is a special floating-point value
#  recognized by all systems that use the standard IEEE floating-point representation



#Pandas treat None and NaN as essentially interchangeable
# for indicating missing or null values.
# To facilitate this convention, there are several useful
# functions for detecting,removing, and replacing
# null values in Pandas DataFrame :

#Handling Missing values in dataset
#1) isnull()
#2) notnull()
#3) dropna()
#4) fillna()
#5) replace()
#6) interpolate()
